                        The cruiser, also nicknamed a chopper, was designed for cruising, hence, how it got its name. 
                        It typically has a little lower seat height, making it a good “cruising” around-town motorcycle, but with added luggage, it can make a good weekend rider. 
                        Again, the engine sizes vary from a small displacement engine to 1,000cc or more, depending on the brand. 
                        You may feel more like you’re sitting in a cruiser than on it, but it’s a great option for both new and experienced riders. 
                        When you imagine a cruiser (specifically a chopper), Harley-Davidson may be the first brand that comes to mind. 
                        We recommend looking at the H-D Low Rider for a good example of a cruiser. 
                        It’s a low-slung motorcycle that can travel for miles and has a lot of accessories to make it a great motorcycle for a quick trip or a good weekend out on the road.
